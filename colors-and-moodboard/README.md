# colors-and-moodboard

## Project Overview

Find the Colors is a creative exercise designed to enhance UI/UX design skills by exploring color palettes, typography, and layout aesthetics using Figma. Participants will extract color schemes, analyze typography, and replicate UI components to build visually cohesive deliverables.

**This project focuses on:**

- Creating color palettes from existing websites.
- Identifying color combinations.
- Designing moodboards with matching typography.
- Replicating UI screens with organized and named layers in Figma.

## Deliverables

- Color Palettes:
Extract 3-4 main colors from each of 7 specified websites.
Compile screenshots, URLs, and color codes in a well-organized Figma file.

- Color Combinations:
Identify examples of 6 types of color palettes (e.g., Monochromatic, Complementary).
Document examples in a Figma file with screenshots, URLs, and color details.

- Moodboards:
Create 4 moodboards for given scenarios, including consistent images and extracted colors.
Match the moodboards with appropriate typography.

- Typography Analysis:
Detect and document fonts used in a set of websites.
Integrate findings into a Figma file, formatted for clarity.

- UI Replication Challenges:
Recreate specific UI screens (e.g. Timer, Watches, Flight Dashboard) with named layers, symbols, and variants in Figma.
